 ** NOT FINISHED **
 
 
 
 
 This is my first ever attempt to make a public script. If you see you can make a improvement on it please make a pull request.

 It has all the basics and may add more stuff in the future.
 


** This Script is basically qb-policejob but changed in a way to suit the prison job **
